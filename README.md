# Software-verification 2023 (at Radboud)
Created a NuSMV (https://nusmv.fbk.eu/) elevator simulation
<br> with DaniÃ«l Schenk <br>
Feedback:<br>
- 2pts for the basic requirements.
- 1pt for the additional requirement, note that 5 and 7 are exactly the same, so I have only given points for one of the two.
- 2.5pts for the NuSMV model. This is a nice, conscise model, good job!
- 2pts for additional features: distinguishing between up/down requests and elevator moves in a direction until reaching the requested floor.
- 2pts for all requirements being successfully checked.
- 0.5pts for an elevator with 7 floors.
<br>Total 10/12 points
